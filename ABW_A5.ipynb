For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Each unit of product 1 gives a profit of €1, and each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of €2.

Each frankfurter requires 0.25 pound of pork product. All the other ingredients in the buns and frankfurters are in plentiful supply. Finally, the labor force at Weenies and Buns consists of 5 employees working full time (40 hours per week each). Each frankfurter requires 3 minutes of labor, and each bun requires 2 minutes of labor. Each frankfurter yields a profit of €0.88, and each bun yields a profit of €0.33.
